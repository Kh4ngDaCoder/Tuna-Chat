A LAN chatroom made in Python!

TunaChat was a small project I made while learning about socket, and now I'm publishing it!
## ====== Installation ======
```
git clone https://github.com/Kh4ngDaCoder/tuna-chat.git
cd tuna-chat
```
## ====== How to use? ======

### -====Server====-
1. Step 1: Run a Virtual Lan Network like Radmin, Hamachi,... ~~(Actually, you can use it on your own Lan address.)~~
2. Step 2: Execute the command below:
```
py Server.py {Your Port}
```
3. (Replace the {Your Port} with a IP Port)
4. If you see the text "Running..." then you're good to go!
### -====Client====-
1. Step 1: run a virtual LAN network like Radmin or Hamachi, and make sure you're in the same party with the one who hosts the server!
2. Step 2: Run The .exe file in the dist folder (Outside is the open-sourced one)
3. Step 3: Put in the server's VLAN address (you can see that on the program).
4. Step 4: Put in the server's port that I mentioned at the top!
5. Step 5: If you see "Connect Successful!, Welcome To TunaChat!" on the screen, then you're ready to chat now! Choose a cool nickname and start rolling!!
